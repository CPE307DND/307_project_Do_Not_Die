1. As a millenial, I want to play a game that renovates my favorite childhood game, so that I can feel the nostalgia and relive my youth.
2. As a casual gamer, I want to play a game that is made using pre-classic mechanics, so that I can play a minimalistic text game.
3. As a board game enthusiast, I want to see a video game adaptation of Dungeons and Dragons, so that I can have fun playing campaigns by myself.
