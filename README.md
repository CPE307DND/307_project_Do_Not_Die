This is a school project, for our CSC 307 class at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
Our group members are: Cristian Rangel, George Saro, James Kwan, Justin Herrera, and Kort Heyneman

The aim is to make it a Dungeons and Dragons lookalike, but there is only so much we can get to during the quarter.
If you are reading this, feel free to play it and enjoy it if you can, but realize there are things that don't work, and please don't make changes, as it is literally homework for us, so that would be cheating.
